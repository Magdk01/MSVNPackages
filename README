# MSVN Packages

This is a simple cluster of all the python functions and methods used repeatably by me,
collected in a package for easier use.

For use cases and documentation read the code :)

To install:
1. Navigate to the project folder 
2. Open Terminal at the directory
3. Activate environment where the package is wanted
4. Run $ pip install .
